I house my pure-python implementations for essential robotics algorithms.

The main benefits are:

- Have a single source of truth of various algorithms with clear explanation.
- Implemented with clear separation between dynamics, environment and algorithm, emphasizing that a lot of algorithms, e.g planing under uncertainties, optimal control, share the same underlying problem formulationï¼Œeg. MDP.
