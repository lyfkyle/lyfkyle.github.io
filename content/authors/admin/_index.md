## About Me

I am a full-stack robotics software engineer with a wide range of experiences, spanning from writing low-level embedded real-time controller for drones to implementing high-level task and motion planners for mobile manipulators, from publishing papers on academic conferences to releasing products into consumer's hands. Currently, I focus on integrating robot seamlessly into everyday life.
